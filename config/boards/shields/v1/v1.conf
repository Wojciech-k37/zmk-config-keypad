# This file will be copied into the user's config directory when they add this
# keyboard. Define any Kconfig options users may frequently want to set here,
# but leave them commented out, for example:

# Uncomment to enable the encoder
# CONFIG_EC11_TRIGGER_GLOBAL_THREAD=y

# Uncomment to enable the display
# CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY=y
# Disable Display (Fixes crash if I2C/SPI are disabled)
CONFIG_ZMK_DISPLAY=n

# Disable RGB Underglow (Fixes potential conflicts with SPI/PWM)
CONFIG_ZMK_RGB_UNDERGLOW=n
CONFIG_WS2812_STRIP=n

# Disable External Power Control (Frees up potential conflicts)
CONFIG_ZMK_EXT_POWER=n

# Keep Battery Reporting ON (Since we moved the wire to Pin 19, this is safe!)
CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY=y


CONFIG_SERIAL=n
CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE=n
